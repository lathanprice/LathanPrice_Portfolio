        <p>Hello! My name is Lathan. I'm currently a computer engineering undergraduate student. Some of my skills include programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.
            I also enjoy tinkering with hardware. When I was in elementary school, I worked on my first PC with my dad. A few years later, I built my first PC on my own.
            I'm specifically looking forward to learning about computer hardware design and I'm hoping to get a job in this specific designation in the future. Some of my hobbies include watching
            One Piece, going to the gym, and working on my physical and mental health.
